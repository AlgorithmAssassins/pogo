## Overview

The Olympics Games Oversight is a web application that provides comprehensive information about the history of the Olympics. It includes details about the timeline, various types of Olympics, and specific game information. Additionally, the project incorporates three essential features: Badge Analysis, Sports Predictor, and Timeline, to offer insights into medal achievements by different countries in Olympic Games. The project is built using a tech stack comprising HTML, CSS, JS, Jupyter Notebook, SCSS, and Python, and utilizes the Mapbox API for mapping functionalities.

## Features

1. **Timeline**: The timeline feature is a visual representation of all the Olympic Games hosted around the world. It showcases the venues and the number of medals earned in each event, providing users with a clear picture of the Olympics' global reach and success.

2. **Types of Olympics**: This section highlights the various types of Olympic Games, including Youth Olympics, Summer Olympics, Winter Olympics, and Paralympics. Users can discover the differences and unique characteristics of each type.

4. **Badge Analysis**: Badge Analysis offers data-driven insights into the number of medals secured by each country throughout Olympic history. Users can examine patterns, compare performances, and draw conclusions from the provided statistics.

5. **Sports Predictor**: The Sports Predictor employs predictive modelling techniques to forecast the number of medals countries are likely to secure in the upcoming Olympics. This feature uses historical data and statistical analysis to make informed predictions.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Jupyter Notebook (for data analysis and modelling)
- SCSS (for improved CSS preprocessing)
- Python (for data manipulation and analysis)
- Mapbox API (for interactive mapping functionality)


## Usage

- The main application page provides links to navigate through different sections, such as Types of Olympics, and the three unique features (Badge Analysis, Sports Predictor, and Timeline).
- Click on the desired section to explore the information and interact with the available features.
- The Badge Analysis feature allows users to see the distribution of medals for each country.
- The Sports Predictor feature takes user inputs or uses default values to predict the number of medals countries might secure in the next Olympics.

  
## Acknowledgments

- The project was inspired by the Geekathon under Geek-Olympics conducted GeeksForGeeks Portal and also driven by a passion for sports and the desire to explore the history of the Olympics.

- Special thanks to the Mapbox team for providing the APIs to create interactive maps.
